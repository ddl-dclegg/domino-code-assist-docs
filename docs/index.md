# Low Code Assistant‚Ñ¢ (LCA) 


# üèÉ Quickstart

## Test

Low Code Assistant‚Ñ¢ (LCA) provides GUI shortcuts for common analysis boilerplate.

> *Requirements:* JupyterLab 3 or Jupyter - Python 3.6 or higher

To get started,

1. Run this command in Jupyter notebook or JupyterLab
```
!pip install --user low-code-assistant
```

2. After this command finishes running, refresh your browser.

3. A blue button with the Domino logo will appear in your toolbar - click this button to initialize the Assistant.

If you restart your workspace, you will need to do steps 1-3 again. To enable LCA more permanently, please see "Make LCA a default configuration" below.

# üåê Make LCA a default configuration

There are 2 ways to make LCA a default configuration:

 * [Enable in a Domino Project](#enabling-low-code-assistant-for-a-domino-project), or
 * [Enable in a Domino Compute Environment](#enabling-low-code-assistant-for-a-domino-compute-environment) (recommended)

# üìà Accelerate new Python/R analysts

Low Code Assistant‚Ñ¢ (LCA) accelerates common data analysis tasks by autogenerating Python or R code with point & click GUIs.

For example, LCA can autogenerate Python or R code for these tasks:

1. ‚ùÑÔ∏è Import data from a business store like S3, [Snowflake](https://dominodatalab.github.io/low-code-jupyter-docs/getting-started/loading-data/snowflake/), or [Redshift](https://dominodatalab.github.io/low-code-jupyter-docs/getting-started/loading-data/redshift/)
2. ü§† [Munge or "wrangle" data](https://dominodatalab.github.io/low-code-jupyter-docs/getting-started/transform/) into a desired format
3. üìä [Create and share data visualizations](https://dominodatalab.github.io/low-code-jupyter-docs/getting-started/viz/scatter/)
4. üéöÔ∏è [Create  and share data apps](https://dominodatalab.github.io/low-code-jupyter-docs/getting-started/app/create/)

In tests with analysts new to Python (new graduates), Low Code Assistant (LCA) enhanced productivity by 5-20x:

  
| Task                          | Python Novice - Productivity Gain       | Python Expert - Productivity Gain      |
| :---                          | :---                                    | :---          |
| Make a statistical data visualization                             | 5x faster with LCA     | 1x faster with LCA    |
| Connect to Snowflake and import data as a dataframe               | 5x faster with LCA     | 2x faster with LCA    |
| Make a Dash/Shiny app where users can upload their own data       | 10x faster with LCA    | 2x faster with LCA    |
| Publish & share an interactive dashboard                          | 20x faster with LCA    | 3x faster with LCA    |
