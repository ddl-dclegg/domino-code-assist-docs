# Low Code Assistant (LCA) 

The Low Code Assistant (LCA) provides a simple, intuitive point-and-click interface for generating Python or R code. It aims to enable those not familiar with writing code to quickly become productive in Domino Data Lab.

Low Code Assistant (LCA) accelerates common data analysis tasks by autogenerating Python or R code with point & click GUIs.

For example, LCA can autogenerate Python or R code for these tasks:

1. Import data from a Cloud stores like [S3](/loading-data/redshift/), [Snowflake](/loading-data/snowflake/), or [Redshift](/loading-data/redshift/).
2. Wrangle data with operations like [filtering](/transform/filter) and [aggregation](/transform/group-aggregate).
3. Create [visualizations](/visualization/plotly).
4. Create [data apps](/app/create).
5. Quickly and easily deploy data apps.

In tests with analysts new to Python (new graduates), LCA enhanced productivity by 5-20x:
  
| Task                          | Novice - Productivity Gain       | Expert - Productivity Gain      |
| :---                          | :---                                    | :---          |
| Make a statistical data visualization                             | 5x faster with LCA     | 1x faster with LCA    |
| Connect to Snowflake and import data               | 5x faster with LCA     | 2x faster with LCA    |
| Make an app where users can upload their data       | 10x faster with LCA    | 2x faster with LCA    |
| Publish & share an interactive dashboard                          | 20x faster with LCA    | 3x faster with LCA    |
