# Introduction

## What is this?

Domino Low Code Assistant (LCA) accelerates common routines in Jupyter notebook with a GUI assistant (such as importing data, data munging, and creating/editing charts). Every interaction with the LCA generates the underlying Python code that is being executed, helping beginning practitioners to learn and edit essential Python data science code.




<!-- ### Short demo -->

<!-- This video shows how to

  * Initialize the assistant
  * Open the *'Load data'* UI from the Assistant
  * Navigate to the `titanic.csv` file.
  * Click the file, to generate the `Pandas` code
 -->
