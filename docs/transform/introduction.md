Data transformations are the core actions that are applied to almost any set of data. Code Assist makes it easy to apply one or more transformations to clean and prepare your data. Specifically it provides a simple point-and-click interface to the following operations:

- drop or select columns and
- [group and aggregate columns](../group-aggregate).
